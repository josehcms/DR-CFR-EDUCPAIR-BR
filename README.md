This repository contains the replication materials of the [paper published in Demographic Research](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol46/6/default.htm#:~:text=Results%3A%20The%20CFR%20of%20couples,these%20reductions%20in%20cohort%20fertility.). This work was the result of my master thesis research and it was supervised by [Dr Everton Lima](https://www.ifch.unicamp.br/ifch/colaboradores/demografia/625/everton-emanuel-campos-de-lima) and co-supervised by [Dr Maria Coleta](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3454564839423365). It was funded by the [Brazilian National Council for scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br).

The R scripts used to read, process, analyse and visualize the IPUMS data of Brazilian censuses of 1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010 are at the [R directory](https://github.com/josehcms/DR-CFR-EDUCPAIR-BR/tree/main/R). The instructions to retrieve the data from IPUMS are described in the [readme file of the replication material of the paper](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol46/6/files/readme.46-6.txt). Finally, the figures and tables of the paper are posted in [OUTPUTS/FIGS](https://github.com/josehcms/DR-CFR-EDUCPAIR-BR/tree/main/OUTPUTS/FIGS) and [OUTPUTS/TABLES](https://github.com/josehcms/DR-CFR-EDUCPAIR-BR/tree/main/OUTPUTS/TABLES) directories, respectively.
