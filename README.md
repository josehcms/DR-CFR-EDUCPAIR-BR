# Educational Pairings and Fertility Decline in Brazil: An Analysis Through Cohort Fertility

This repository contains the replication materials of the paper recently published in Demographic Research. This work was the result of my master thesis research and it was supervised by [Dr Everton Lima](https://www.ifch.unicamp.br/ifch/colaboradores/demografia/625/everton-emanuel-campos-de-lima) and co-supervised by [Dr Maria Coleta](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3454564839423365). It was funded by the [Brazilian National Council for scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br).

The R scripts used to read, process, analyse and visualize the IPUMS data of Brazilian censuses of 1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010 are at the [R directory](https://github.com/josehcms/DR-CFR-EDUCPAIR-BR/tree/main/R). The [DATA](https://github.com/josehcms/DR-CFR-EDUCPAIR-BR/tree/main/DATA) directory contains the raw IPUMS data sets (in [DATA/IPUMS](https://github.com/josehcms/DR-CFR-EDUCPAIR-BR/tree/main/DATA/IPUMS)) and the processed data sets (in [DATA/PROCESSED](https://github.com/josehcms/DR-CFR-EDUCPAIR-BR/tree/main/DATA/PROCESSED)). Finally, the figures and tables of the paper are posted in [OUTPUTS/FIGS](https://github.com/josehcms/DR-CFR-EDUCPAIR-BR/tree/main/OUTPUTS/FIGS) and [OUTPUTS/TABLES](https://github.com/josehcms/DR-CFR-EDUCPAIR-BR/tree/main/OUTPUTS/TABLES) directories, respectively.
